# Norvig's lispy: beautiful and illuminating

## Abstract

Why isn't if a function?
Why does Python need to add keywords from time to time?
What precisely is a closure, what problem does it solve, and how does it work?
These are some of the fundamental questions you'll be able to answer after this tutorial:
an interactive exploration of Peter Norvig's `lis.py`–an interpreter for
a subset of the Scheme dialect of Lisp written in Python.

## Description

Peter Norvig of Stanford University wrote `lis.py`:
an interpreter for a subset of the Scheme dialect of Lisp in 132 lines of readable Python.
I took Norvig's beautiful code, updated it to modern Python coding style,
and integrated it into a Jupyter notebook with explanations as well as
interactive experiments and exercises checked automatically.

Why should you study lis.py? This is what I got out of it:

* Learning how an interpreter works gave me a deeper understanding of Python and programming languages in general—interpreted or compiled.

* The simplicity of Scheme is a master class of language design.

* `lis.py` is a beautiful example of idiomatic Python code.

## Audience

This tutorial is for practicing Python programmers who want to learn idiomatic Python coding
through a beautiful, powerful example showcasing modern Python best practices.
Attendees will experiment with a functional interpreter,
learning fundamental concepts about parsing,
recursive evaluation of expressions and control structures,
representing functions with closures—among other topics.

## Format

With Norvig's permission, I've updated `lis.py` and integrated it into a
[Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/fluentpython/lispy/blob/main/workshops/thoughtworks2021/norvigs-lispy.ipynb)
so that attendees can study and experiment with each major component as we build the interpreter.
The notebook runs on Binder, so attendees don't need to install anything:
they will do all experimentation and coding exercises using just a Web browser.
We will do 30 minutes of exercises, split in three segments.
